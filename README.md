This project provides an insight into exploring options for renting vs. buying. Although income has increased significantly in certain cities like San Francisco and San Jose, renting AND purchasing a home over the last 10 years has become unaffordable overall in California
In certain cities like New York and Washington, D.C., home prices have increased but rent increases have stayed fairly flat. Therefore, it’s better to rent in those markets than it us to buy. 

Limitations to our research included the following:
Our data doesn’t consider gentrification. That is, are incomes increasing because companies are paying more or are higher earners moving into these areas? Or both?
Our data does not include property taxes, insurance and HOAs, which significantly increases the cost of owning a home in places like New York and New Jersey. 
Our data does not include income taxes, which are significantly higher in cities like New York and San Francisco and are nonexistent in Austin, Texas and Seattle, Washington.
